### Decrypting the strange subreddit [/r/A858DE45F56D9BC9](http://www.reddit.com/r/A858DE45F56D9BC9).

#### Hints

* [/u/fragglet](http://www.reddit.com/u/fragglet) deployed a scraper and auto-analyzer for postshere: [soulsphere.org](http://a858.soulsphere.org/). It is [on github](https://github.com/fragglet/A858nalyze)
* the format changed at some point.  [old format](http://www.reddit.com/r/A858DE45F56D9BC9/comments/1p26fo/201310231949/) vs [new format](http://www.reddit.com/r/A858DE45F56D9BC9/comments/1p320v/201310231559/)
* each post is of various length and some may be cut off
* it appears to be hex encoded data that probably breaks down into binary
* it does not directly convert from hex to ASCII
* sometimes when broken down into binary, the number of bits does not evenly divide by 8.  It does divide by 4.


#### Community

* there is [a subreddit devoted to solving this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Solving_A858/).
* there is [a wiki on it](https://www.reddit.com/r/Solving_A858/wiki/index)


#### Running the Decoder
Just execute it.  Make sure you have ruby installed.  Specify one of the test files that are in the repo to run against when prompted.
