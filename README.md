### Decrypting the strange subreddit [/r/A858DE45F56D9BC9](http://www.reddit.com/r/A858DE45F56D9BC9).

#### Hints

* there appears to be a site using the data at [soulsphere.org](http://a858.soulsphere.org/)
* the format changed at some point.  [old format](http://www.reddit.com/r/A858DE45F56D9BC9/comments/1p26fo/201310231949/) vs [new format](http://www.reddit.com/r/A858DE45F56D9BC9/comments/1p320v/201310231559/)
* each post is of various length and some may be cut off
* it appears to be hex encoded data that probably breaks down into binary
* sometimes when broken down into binary, the number of bits does not evenly divide by 8.  It does divide by 4.


#### Running the Decoder
Just execute it.  Make sure you have ruby installed.  Specify one of the test files that are in the repo to run against when prompted.
